WHY AIRFLOW:
- set the order of the tasks
- make sure each tasks are done when the previous task are done
- control the timing of the entire data process

WHAT IS AIRFLOW:
- airflow is a pen source platform to author,scedule and monitor workflows
benefits
1)flexibility:python based,dynamic tasks,dynamic workflows,branching(execute diff set of tasks based on condition)
2)scalability
3)fully functional user interface
4)extensibility

CORE COMPONENTS:
1)web-server:(dashboard for car check speed,fuel etc)
web server provides the user interface you see when you use airflow
view,monitor,manage workflows through web browser
2)scheduler:(alarm clock where the clock wakesup exact time everyday we set)
it determines when the tasks should run
it ensures tasks run in correct order
3)the meta database:(airflows memory, it has tasks have run,when they ran and their results)
stores the information of tasks and status
it keeps all the important details of workflows
4)triggerer:(important email before starting the task- airflow will notify once the email received we can focus on other meantime)
it manages the deferable tasks- tasks that wait for external events
without blocking by other process it will handle tasks
5)executor:(traffic controller, decides which car should go first to reduce traffic to optimize performance)
it determines how the tasks will be run
whether the tasks run parallel or in sequence
6)queue:(line at coffee shop)
list of tasks waiting to be executed
7)worker:(airflow- restaurent, the workers are chefs take order from queue and execute them)
performs the tasks
