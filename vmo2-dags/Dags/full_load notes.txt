step-1:
main procedure PRC_MIG_GCOMS_FEATURE it contains 4 parameters
inputs:
p_fno - related to feature
p_fid - 
p_dml
output:
p_query

step-2:
if p_query is delete and pfno not in fiber splice enclousure
opening a loop and selecting COLUMN_ORDER,DATA_EXCHANGE_FIELD from tb_components and data_mapping tables

if data_exchange_field is vmx_id or vmx_change_type then data is stored
if not then storing the value null for all other columns

step-3:
if p_query is insert or update
we are checking if p_fno in child if yes then assigning parent fno to v_fno

opening a loop and selecting TC.G3E_TABLE,TC.IS_MAIN_table,DM.COLUMN_NAME,COLUMN_ORDER,TC.TABLE_ALIAS,DATA_EXCHANGE_FIELD,TC.FEAT_USERNAME,DM.DATA_TYPE from tb_components and data_mapping tables

if is_main_table is Y then store the table_alias in v_main_alias(TB0)

in if else conditions we are checking each column and making the logic
in document if the fileds are empty then we are making logic, if not we then it comes under one to one mapping
