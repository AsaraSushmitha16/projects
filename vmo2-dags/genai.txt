- ai can be categorized into 2 sections
1)gen ai(creates new content can be text,images,video,audio ex:chatgpt)
2)non gen ai(create the models based on data ex: with credit history provide loan or not)
 
- evolution:
1)statistical ml
(it accepts structured data and image detection)
 
but complex images cant be done by statistical ml
so neural networks came
2)neural networks
3)recurrent neural network
used for language translation
4)language model
predicts the next word that comes in the sentence
self supervised learning
give the data from any website,book,articles and training pairs then train the neural network
this predicts the next word in a sentence(ex:gmail)
5)transformers
text-to-text-models:
a)bert
b)GPT-4: 175 billion parameters(generative pre-trained transformer)
text-to-image-models:
a)dall-e
b)stable diffusion
text-to-video-models:
a)openai sora

- LLM(large language model)
language model
predicts the next word that comes in the sentence(ex:gmail)
large language model
this models are trained with large datasets or volume either it may be wikipedia,google,online books etc(ex:chatgpt)
palm2--boogle
lama---meta
reinforcement learning with human feedback-chatgpt used many humnas interventions to make less toxic

- embeddings and vector database
embeddings->numeric representation of text in form of vector
vector database--> it allows to store the embeddings and perform efficient search
semantic search - undestanding the sentence and gives search result
a)cosine similarity for matching result
b)index database with hashing(locality sensitive hashing)

tools for genai-chatgpt4
azure-openai service
aws-amazon bedrock

commercial models
gpt gemini

opensource models
mistral llama2

langchain--its a python frramework for developing applications
we can write code and plug to the gpt4 or llama2
hugging face
pytorch

LANGCHAIN FUNDAMENTALS
chatgpt  ->openai api-->gpt3.5 or gpt4
chatgpt is an application
gpt3.5 or gpt4 is llm

application--openai api--llm
limitations are 
higher cost
no access to internet/real time knowledge
no access to private data sources

your llm application---langchain---openai,hugging face bloom
				   google,database etc
