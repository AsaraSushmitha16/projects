FUNDAMENTAL AI CONCEPTS


INTRODUCTION TO AI:
ai is the software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities
1)machine learning:we teach to computer model to make predictions and output the conclusions from data
2)computer vision:to show the world visually through cameras,video and images
3)natural language processing:computer to show writtern or spoken language and respond in kind
4)document intelligence:ai can read and process the large ammounts of data in formas or documents
5)knowledge mining:it can extract information from large volumes of unstructured data to create searchable knowledge
6)generative ai:creates content in variety of formats including natural language,image,code and more

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNDERSTAND MACHINE LEARNING:
1)collect data
2)label the data based on their different types
3)use algorithm to fetch the features
4)results are stored in model
5)when new sample we give to the model, it can predict the feature of it

services in microsoft:
1)automated machine learning:non-experts to quickly create an effective ml model from data
2)azure machine learning designer:its a graphical interface enables no-code development of mahine learning solutions
3)data metric visualization:analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization
4)notebooks:write and run code in jupyter notebook servers that integrates in studio


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTAND COMPUTER VISION
its a model that can be applied to visual input from cameras,videos or images
1)image classification:
classifies the image based on content
ex:taxi in traffic or busses,cyclist
2)object detection:
it identifies to individual objects and location with bounding box
ex:bus,car,cycle
3)semantic segmentation:
it identifies each object with unique color
bus-->read
car-->blue
cyclist-->green
4)image analysis:
it will read the image content and give description
ex:a person with a dog on a street
5)face detection,analysis, and recognition:
it will identify the facial features and classifies
6)optical character recognition:
read the text from the image

computer vision services in microsoft azure:
1)image analysis
2)face
3)optical character recognition


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTAND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
with nlp we can create software that understand written and spoken language
1)analyze and interpret text in documents,emails
2)interpt spoken language and synthesize speech responses
3)automatically translate spoken or written phrases between language
4)can read commands and determine appropriate actions

NLP in microsoft azure:
1)azure ai speech


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTANDING DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE MINING
azure ai document intelligence is a service in azure used to automatic read and process the documents that can be any format

knowledge mining:extract the data from large volumes that can be unstructured and used for searching
azure ai search service is a service in azure that used to build indexes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNDERSTANDING GENERATIVE AI

it takes input as nlp and gives output as variety of format including nlp,image,code and audio
azure openai service is a service in azure used for chatbot 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGES AND RISKS WITH AI

1)bias can affect results
2)errors may cause harm
3)data could be exposed
4)solutions may not work for everyone
5)users must trust a complex system
6)whos liable for ai-driven decizsions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNDERSTAND RESPONSIBLE AI
1)fairness->treat all people without baised
2)reliability and safety-->automation vehicles or in hospital tools it should be worked correct
3)privacy and security-->data should be kept private and secure
4)inclusiveness-->include all the people and treat everyone same
5)transparency-->should know what ai does and what not
6)accountability-->should meet the ethical and legal standards that clearly defined

FUNDAMENTALS OD MACHINE LEARNING

WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING:
data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING



supervised machine learning                           unsupervised machine learning
     |                 |                                 |
regression             classification                   clustering
                       |            |
                  binary             multiclass
                classification       classification


supervised machine learning:[x1,x2,x3],y
data contains both features(x1,x2,x3) and labels(y)
the unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases

regression:(linear regression)
it gives the output as numeric
ex:no of ice creams sold on given day based on temp
no of liters fuel can store in vehicle based on vehicle properties
price of land based on are
1)mean absolute error:mean of values
2)mean squared error:mean of squared of values
3)root mean squared error:root of mean of squared of values
4)coefficient of determination(r^2):R2 = 1- ∑(y-ŷ)^2 ÷ ∑(y-ȳ)^2

binary classification:(logistic regression)
returns true/false or positive/negative
ex:whether a patient is at risk of diabetics based on age,weight,blood glucose level
whether a customer takes loan in bank based on income,age,credit history
whether a customer will respond to mail offers
1)confusion matrix
It's a table that shows how well the model is predicting outcomes. It includes True Positives (correctly predicted positives), True Negatives (correctly predicted negatives), False Positives (predicted positive but actually negative), and False Negatives (predicted negative but actually positive).
2)accuracy
Simply put, it's how often the model is correct. But it can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced.
3)recall
It's the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all actual positive cases. High recall means few false negatives.
4)f1-score
It's a balance between precision and recall. It's useful when you need to consider both false positives and false negatives



multiclass classification:
label that represents one of multiple posssible classifies
ex:the species of a penguin (Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap) based on its physical measurements
The genre of a movie (comedy, horror, romance, adventure, or science fiction) based on its cast, director, and budget
two algorithms
1)one-vs-rest(OvR) algorithms-creates each function to different class
2)multinomail algorithms-creates single function but contains 3 predicted values in array
unsupervised machine learning:
it only contains the features not labels

clustering:
identifies similarities between observations based on features,groups them into discrete clsuters
ex:Group similar flowers based on their size, number of leaves, and number of petals
algorithm:K-Means clustering
